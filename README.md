## Info
You still need to Texture Scribe outside blender!

When you gonna texture scribe make sure you name your textures this way:
- Diffuse: `<your_texture>_D`
- Normal Map: `<your_texture>_N`
- Specular Look: `<your_texture>_S`

When exporting the model from blender you specify the texture name as: `<your_texture>`.
